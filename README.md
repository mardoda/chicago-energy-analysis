# Chicago Energy Consumption Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing energy consumption in Chicago, focusing on electrical and thermal energy usage. The analysis leverages Python tools to handle large datasets efficiently and perform complex data manipulations.

## Data Import and Setup
- **Initial Setup**: Configuration of the data processing environment.
- **Data Import**: Data is imported from a CSV file, creating initial dataframes for analysis.

## Data Preparation
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removal of unnecessary columns such as 'census block' and 'building subtype'.
   - Standardization of column names by converting them to lowercase and removing spaces.
   - Handling missing values by replacing them with the average of the respective columns.

2. **Data Viewing**:
   - Examination of the dataset structure and initial rows.
   - Calculation of distinct counts of column values to understand data distribution.

## Data Analysis
- **Energy Classification**: Separate dataframes for electrical and thermal energy.
- **Consumption Patterns**:
   - Monthly maximum consumption analysis for electrical energy in 2010, identifying December as the peak month.
   - Analysis of geographical distribution of energy usage, highlighting areas with high consumption.

## Advanced Data Handling Techniques
- Demonstrates the use of Python data processing functions to handle large datasets efficiently, including transformations and aggregations.

## Comparative Analysis: Python Data Handling vs. Traditional Methods
### Advantages of Python Data Handling
1. **Scalability**: Efficiently manages large datasets with data processing libraries.
2. **Flexibility**: Adaptable to various data manipulation tasks.
3. **Community Support**: Wide range of libraries and community support for complex data analysis.

### Limitations of Traditional Methods
- Less efficient in handling very large datasets without specialized software.
- Generally slower and less flexible for complex data transformations.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of Python data handling in analyzing large-scale data, providing insights into energy consumption patterns in Chicago.
